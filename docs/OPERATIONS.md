# Operations runbook

## Health

- `/health/live`: process is running.
- `/health/ready`: database is reachable and the latest required migration is applied (currently `008_alert_end_debounce.sql`).
- `/api/v1/sources/health`: configured, current, stale, error and unconfigured source states.
- `/ops/api`: Basic-auth protected worker, AI, source and database state.
- `/ops`: operator console. Credentials are held only in the active tab's memory; it can add, verify, activate and hide recommended Telegram channels.
- `/metrics`: open in development; in production requires `METRICS_TOKEN` Bearer auth or ops Basic auth.

The site continues to show the last known state when SSE disconnects and marks it stale. A stale official source must never be presented as current.

## Routine commands

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f app
docker compose exec -T app curl -fsS http://localhost:3000/health/ready
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U threatlens -d threatlens -c 'TABLE schema_migrations'
```

## Backups

The backup container creates a custom-format archive, validates it with `pg_restore --list`, and writes a SHA-256 sidecar. Retention defaults to 14 days.

Perform a real isolated restore test after material schema changes:

```bash
docker compose exec -T backup sh /usr/local/bin/restore-test.sh /backups/threatlens-TIMESTAMP.dump
```

Production backups must additionally be encrypted and copied to independent object storage. That storage account is an external setup task.

## Incident responses

- **Official API stale/error:** public site enters degraded state; do not infer alert end from timeout.
- **Provider died completely while an alert was active — the alert stays active indefinitely.** This
  is a designed boundary, not a hang. Alert state is only ever re-evaluated *by a poll*: there is no
  separate expiry timer. A provider whose requests all fail produces no snapshot, so its
  `alert_source_states` rows freeze in their last state — `active=true` — and the aggregate keeps
  seeing a source that holds the alert. Holding a stale alert is deliberately preferred to announcing
  an all-clear nobody confirmed. (A provider that *does* answer but stops listing the alert is the
  normal case and self-heals: the debounce window runs out and the next poll ends the alert.)

  How to see it: `/api/v1/sources/health` and `/ops` show the source as `error` or `stale` while
  `/api/v1/alerts` still lists alerts. Confirm which alerts are held open by which source:

  ```bash
  docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U threatlens -d threatlens -c "
    SELECT p.location_id, p.alert_type, p.started_at,
           s.source_id, s.active, s.missing_since, s.last_seen_at, src.health_status
    FROM alert_periods p
    JOIN alert_source_states s ON s.location_id=p.location_id AND s.alert_type=p.alert_type
    JOIN sources src ON src.id=s.source_id
    WHERE p.status='active' ORDER BY p.started_at"
  ```

  A row with `active=true`, a `last_seen_at` that stopped advancing and `health_status='error'` is a
  frozen holder. Response, in order:

  1. Fix the provider — token, quota, upstream outage. The first successful poll reconciles the alert
     through the normal path, either confirming it or starting its debounce window.
  2. If the outage will be long and another official source is already clear, mark the frozen rows as
     missing so the surviving source's next poll can end the alert:
     `UPDATE alert_source_states SET active=false, missing_since=now()-interval '1 hour' WHERE source_id='…';`
     This still goes through the reconciler, so `ended_at`, `alert.ended` and the subscriber
     notification stay consistent. It only takes effect when some source still polls that location.
  3. Never edit `alert_periods` by hand: the map, the timeline and the monthly analytics all read it,
     and a hand-closed period emits no `alert.ended`, so subscribers are never told.

  Lowering `ALERT_END_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS` does not help in this scenario — with no polls, nothing
  re-evaluates. If *every* official source is down the site is in its documented degraded state and
  the alert layer must be presented as stale, not as current.
- **Telegram 403:** the user is disabled automatically; queued messages stop.
- **Telegram 429:** delivery uses the provider `retry_after` value.
- **AI invalid/timeout:** failure is recorded and deterministic fallback is used.
- **Unknown provider location:** an unmapped provider location is a catalogue gap, not a source outage. Locations that did resolve are persisted normally, the source stays `current`, and the unmapped names are counted and logged (`unresolvedLocationReports()`) instead of being guessed at. The source is only marked `error` when the response contained alerts and **none** of them could be mapped — the snapshot is then refused whole rather than applied partially.
- **Reclaimed notifications:** a row left in `sending` for more than 300 seconds is returned to `retry` on the next delivery pass, or marked `failed` once it has used all 8 attempts. The pass logs `reclaimed notifications stuck in sending` with a count; a non-zero count on every pass means delivery is crashing mid-batch.
- **Occupation layer stale or empty:** `/api/v1/occupation` never returns 5xx. An empty collection with `stale: true` means the source is switched off, no revision has been stored yet, or the database was unreachable. Check `threatlens_occupation_sync_total` and `threatlens_occupation_unknown_status_keys_total`; a rising unknown-key counter means upstream introduced a status key this build rejects by design, and it needs a code review before it can be rendered.
- **Edited monitored message:** revision is stored; incompatible previous event is marked corrected.
- **Incorrect channel recommendation:** hide it in `/ops`; public API, site and bot stop returning it immediately.
